# BB-Comments

This application is an example app meant to demonstrate how easy it is to improve a Backbone app incrementally over time.

To view the progression, you can checkout branches, starting at the 2010 branch and progressing to the 2015 version.

Note that this is not meant (or suitable) to be used as a "starter project", but instead is really meant to exhibit the advantages of Backbone.
